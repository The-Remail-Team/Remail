# Remail
Remail- an email client to contain all your accounts! Remail is an open source email client that contains pretty much all your accounts! Remail currently supports these email services: 

Gmail 

Outlook 

iCloud Mail 

Yahoo Mail 

Mail.com

GMX

Gmail will also work with G Suite addresses.

# Like a web browser
Remail contains the same thing you would have if you were using the service in the browser, but the twist is you have all your adresses together! And any links in the emails will be opened in Remail rather than your browser
