# Remail
Remail- an email client to contain all your accounts!
Remail is an open source email client that contains pretty much all your accounts!
Remail currently supports these email services:

Gmail

Outlook

iCloud Mail

Yahoo Mail

Mail.com

GMX



## Like a web browser
Remail contains the same thing you would have if you were using the service in the browser, but the twist is you have all your adresses together!
And any links in the emails will be opened in Remail rather than your browser



any files in source code that the title is 'r', delete them as I had to make them to make a folder :)

REQUIRES .NET FRAMEWORK 4.8
